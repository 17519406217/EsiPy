# Version 0.2.0
## Changes
* `EsiSecurity` object no longer require `app` object to be initialized to get SSO Urls (authorize, token).
    * You can still use it, as before and your app will still work the same as before
    * You can manually give a `sso_url` instead, to say whether you want SISI / TQ SSO (default is TQ) instead of the app object.
    * If both are given, priority is set to the `app` object.
* Use of https://esi.tech.ccp.is/verify/ for verify instead of the sso endpoint (https://login.eveonline.com/oauth/verify) 

This introduce a small breaking change if you init `EsiSecurity` without keyword, since `app` parameter is no longer the first parameter. You need to: 
* either use keywords to init
* put `app` parameter in the 4th parameter [not recommended]
