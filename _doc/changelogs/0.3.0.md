# Version 0.3.0
## Changes 
* Do not try to cache response if there's no `expires` information. 
* Fix cache behavior to have everywhere the same. See details below.
* Rename signal instances to be fully capitalized.
    * `after_token_refresh` become `AFTER_TOKEN_REFRESH`
    * `api_call_stats` become `API_CALL_STATS`
* Renamed the following `EsiSecurity` methods:
    * `get_access_token_request_params` to become `get_access_token_params`
    * `get_refresh_token_request_params` to become `get_refresh_token_params`

## New Feature: EsiApp
EsiApp is an object that will be used to play with ESI Meta Swagger spec. <br>
That mean you will be able to easily get meta endpoints, like `/verify`, `/status` the same way as the current App object, but it allows you to also get all current swagger spec used in ESI, for versionned endpoint and others.

Please look at the doc for how to use it. 

## Caching behavior change
Until now, cache objects worked differently when timeout was equal to `0` or `None` depending on which engine you used for caching. <br>
To prevent error if switching between engine and to have consistent behavior, if timeout now equals `0` or `None`, the data will not expire.
