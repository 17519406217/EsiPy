# Installation

## Using PIP

It's the easiest way. Simply install it and use it.
```pip install esipy```



## setuptools

Download the latest version (tag, or master) and install the package.
```python setup.py install```



## Manual installation in a project

If you want to use EsiPy within your project, but without using pip or setuptools, just download the latest version and import it.
You will also need the following dependencies :
- requests <br>
- pyswagger <br>
- six <br>
- pytz <br>
